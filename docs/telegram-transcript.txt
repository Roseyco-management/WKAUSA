Geoffrey 🏋️, [16/11/2025 15:59]
Thank you G's

Emil Langager, [16/11/2025 16:17]
I have another question. Would you like us to upload them or just to send them to you?

Geoffrey 🏋️, [16/11/2025 22:28]
Sure just send to me. We'll take care of uploads

Geoffrey 🏋️, [16/11/2025 22:29]
We'll be starting a separate social media account specifically for the organization right now we do promotion through personal accounts, which is not the best or recommended but we're making improvements

Emil Langager, [16/11/2025 22:53]
Just need to lead the audience there G 😁

Emil Langager, [16/11/2025 22:53]
But gotcha we'll send you the videos when they are done

Geoffrey 🏋️, [16/11/2025 22:54]
Absolutely.
The real story here is I need to delegate.
Finding competent people who don't break the bank is nearly impossible.

Allan Chan, [16/11/2025 22:59]
We have a social media team

Allan Chan, [16/11/2025 23:00]
We have some quite a few competent guys looking to prove themselves

Geoffrey 🏋️, [16/11/2025 23:00]
Very nice. If I can generate some more revenue last quarter of this year 1st quarter next we can swing that.

Emil Langager, [18/11/2025 11:40]
Do you have a website for tickets or socials. For CTA for these ads?

Emil Langager, [18/11/2025 11:40]
Or do you buy at the location?

Geoffrey 🏋️, [18/11/2025 18:44]
Both we do in person sales and online.

Theres also a live stream

Purchase tickets:

Live stream link:

Emil Langager, [18/11/2025 18:48]
Great in that case we something to work with.

But the CTA for the links will be link in bio. Since IG doesn't allow links in the description.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [18/11/2025 18:58]
Yep that works.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [19/11/2025 18:37]
Help G's checking to see if you have any videos completed for the CSC event.

Emil Langager, [19/11/2025 19:40]

Emil Langager, [19/11/2025 19:40]

Geoffrey 🏋️, [19/11/2025 23:43]
I like this one, but I would cut down the referee intro to make it a little shorter and get the fighting started if that makes sense.
Specifically, when he is checking to see if the one guy has a mouthguard or not

Geoffrey 🏋️, [19/11/2025 23:44]
That's the second video I'm referring to first one is good thank you

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:03]
Geoffrey one other thing is branding, is that the font you want to settle on?

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:03]
All good fight leagues have a certain branding. Branding is important as we scale but I know it's a tight budget.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [20/11/2025 00:04]
Oh shoot yes.
I have a logos to share. 1 moment.

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:09]

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:09]
Signature font, logo everything

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:09]
Can me and you jump on a call?

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:10]
I want to see if we can fix fights and get gambling involved

Geoffrey 🏋️, [20/11/2025 00:14]
Yes I'm available.

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:16]

Allan Chan, [20/11/2025 00:17]
What time zone you living in?

Geoffrey 🏋️, [20/11/2025 00:17]
Unfortunately not.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [20/11/2025 00:17]
US eastern time (New York time)

Geoffrey 🏋️, [20/11/2025 00:18]
I've uploaded 4 logos.
2 are variations on the WKA logo. The WKA is the sanctioning body.

The other 2 are for the combat sports challenge fight promotion.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [20/11/2025 00:18]
In the same folder.

Emil Langager, [20/11/2025 10:58]

Allan Chan, [30/11/2025 14:45]

Are we able to use dropbox or google drive?

Allan Chan, [30/11/2025 14:59]
I've used iCloud and it shared my photos for some reason

Geoffrey 🏋️, [30/11/2025 15:06]
Oh that's bizarre. I will check the size of my dropbox and see if it works.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [30/11/2025 15:10]
These photos and videos are from our scrimmage league.

A scrimmage league event is done in three phases.

Phase one is the weigh ins where fighters will get their weights taken.

Phase 2 is an instructional portion where we teach them the rules regarding K1 kickboxing, unified rules, kickboxing, and Muay Thai.

Phase 3 is a drilling portion where we give them drills to do.

Phase 4 is controlled contact sparring, where a referee is present to ensure contact remains under control, and one person is present to grade the rounds.

We like to advertise this as an event where people learn the rules so they can fight better

The logic being if you attend these events, you know the rules in depth, and learn how to take advantage of them, and take advantage of your potential opponents, ignorance of them

Geoffrey 🏋️, [30/11/2025 15:10]
I'm on my way to teach a class right now so I will work on uploading those once I get to the gym

Emil Langager, [30/11/2025 15:13]
Also, Geoffrey can you share some of the accounts where you post the videos :)

Geoffrey 🏋️, [02/12/2025 22:01]
I'm having issues getting these media files into anything else

Geoffrey 🏋️, [02/12/2025 22:02]
I'm getting errors when I try to upload them into Dropbox or Google Drive that's killing me at the moment

Allan Chan, [02/12/2025 22:09]
No worries drop it into iCloud brother if it is killing you

Allan Chan, [02/12/2025 22:09]
I don't want to kill you

Geoffrey 🏋️, [02/12/2025 22:10]

Over the next month I'm going to get a Instagram page for WKAUSA, the WKAscrimmageLeague, and CombatSportsChallenge to help differentiate the public branding for each.

Geoffrey 🏋️, [02/12/2025 22:17]
My next steps as far as the website goes, I will be taking a backup of our existing FTP server that is the back end of the current website

If I were to give you guys an access to that, would that be enough to get you guys started building a good sample site?

And I can help the development of all the features that should have.

Allan Chan, [02/12/2025 22:31]
We can do a demo right away

Allan Chan, [02/12/2025 22:31]
Without access

Allan Chan, [02/12/2025 22:31]
This is all we need + iCloud Drive

Allan Chan, [02/12/2025 22:31]
And we can go from there

Geoffrey 🏋️, [02/12/2025 22:57]

Allan Chan, [03/12/2025 14:43]
Ah I thought you had some imagery

Geoffrey 🏋️, [03/12/2025 14:44]
No, I have yet to back up that FTP server we are using.

I'm thinking it's best to back up, stand up new one that I control and grant you access.
